# The GC Wealth Project 

## Introduction

The GC Wealth Project is a comprehensive database of wealth accumulation and its determinants, with the goal of providing a single place for researchers and other members of the civil society to navigate a burgeoning literature. Our project includes data from a variety of global-data producers, scientific papers, national balance sheets, documentation from central banks, and legal tax schedules.

## Getting Started

To download and manipulate the database, users can either visualize it on our website or download it directly from our servers. The database is available in multiple formats, including CSV, Excel, and DTA.

To use the data visualization tools available on our website, users can simply navigate our dedicated website: www.gcwealthproject.com

## Usage

Our project includes three dashboards that offer different views on wealth accumulation dynamics:

1. Wealth topography: This dashboard provides estimates of aggregate net wealth, as well as their distribution among economic sectors, their composition by types of assets and liabilities, allowing comparisons across countries and through time.

2. Inequality trends: This dashboard includes inequality indices, such as the Gini coefficient, but also wealth shares held by different groups of people, i.e., the bottom 50% share, the middle 40%, top 10%, 1% or even 0,1% shares too. Again, allowing for cross country and historical comparisons.

3. Wealth taxation: This dashboard includes information on net wealth taxes, estate taxes, inheritance taxes, and taxes on gifts. There, not only we report information on the evolution of nominal tax rates and effective revenue, but also on the specific rules and exceptions that apply in each country.
